# ANN-InSilico-Mosquito-Repellent-Fabrics
"This project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict the effectiveness of mosquito-repellent compounds on different fabrics. It aims to accelerate smart clothing design that protects against mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue without extensive lab testing."
